## PMMP-AntiCheat-Essentials: A light cheat protection for your server.<br>Status: Currently Work In Progress.
## How is this different to SAC? Well, this AntiCheat focusses on using more performance-friendly, more stable and more simple technology. It won't provide the same Level of Protection as SAC (not nearly), but it will indeed block some of the most annoying Cheats out there. This is, unlike SAC, made to run in huge production enviroments, however, without any warranty whatsoever.
##Planned Features:<br> - AntiReach <br> - AntiOnGroundFake (hardens PMMP's AntiFly against some bypasses)<br> - AntiNoClip
